**MongoDB** (https://www.mongodb.com): MongoDB is an open-source NoSQL document-oriented database. The data model is based on the concept of collections that contain documents in BSON (Binary JSON) format. MongoDB can work in standalone, replica set, and sharded cluster hosting models. Java and Python both use official drivers to access MongoDB. Java driver is available as a JAR file, while Python driver can be installed using pip. Additionally, there are also libraries that support MongoDB like Spring Data MongoDB for Java and PyMongo for Python.
