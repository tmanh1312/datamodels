**InfluxDB** (https://www.influxdata.com): InfluxDB is an open-source time series database that its data is based on the concepts of tags, fields, and a timestamp measurement. Tags are key-value pairs represent the metadata, while fields contain actual data; timestamps record when the data was collected. InfluxDB supports multiple hosting models, including standalone, high availability (HA) clusters, and cloud-based managed instances through InfluxDB Cloud. Java and Python both use official drivers to access InfluxDB. Java driver is a Maven package, while Python driver can be installed using pip. Additionally, there are also libraries that support InfluxDB like Spring Data InfluxDB for Java and InfluxDB-Python for Python.
