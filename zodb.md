**ZODB** (https://zodb.org/en/latest/): ZODB is an open-source object-oriented database. Data is stored as Python objects, including lists, dictionaries, and user-defined classes. ZODB can be used in embedded, client/server, and standalone hosting models. For Python, ZODB offers an API including classes as Connection, Transaction, and Persistent, for programmers to create, read, update, and remove database-stored objects. Thereâ€™s also the Zope Object-Relational Mapping (ZORM) framework, which offers a higher-level abstraction over the ZODB API and enables programmers to map Python classes to database tables.
