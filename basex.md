**BaseX** (https://basex.org): open-source XML database management system. The data model is tree-based, where XML documents are stored as trees. BaseX supports both a client-server and an embedded hosting model. . Java and Python both use official drivers to access BaseX. Java accesses BaseX by using BaseX Java API, while Python uses BaseX Python API. 

BaseX is *different* than other databases as it uses a different structure. BaseX uses trees rather than relational or graph. BaseX supports advanced XML processing that is compatible with XML data storing and querying.
