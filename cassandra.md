**Apache Cassandra** (https://cassandra.apache.org/): Cassandra is an open-source distributed NoSQL database management. Data is stored as columns that are grouped together into column families. Each column consists of a name, a value, and a timestamp, and can be indexed for faster retrieval. Cassandra is typically used in a client/server hosting model. The Java client library is called the DataStax Java Driver, while the Python client library is called the DataStax Python Driver. Along with native libraries, Cassandra also provides REST API.
